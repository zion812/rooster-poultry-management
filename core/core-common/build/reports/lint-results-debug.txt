C:\Users\rowdy\AndroidStudioProjects\rooster-poultry-management\core\core-common\build.gradle.kts:10: Warning: A newer version of compileSdkVersion than 35 is available: 36 [GradleDependency]
    compileSdk = 35
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

C:\Users\rowdy\AndroidStudioProjects\rooster-poultry-management\core\core-common\src\main\java\com\example\rooster\core\common\Extensions.kt:46: Warning: Unnecessary; SDK_INT is always >= 24 [ObsoleteSdkInt]
    return if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {
               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "ObsoleteSdkInt":
   This check flags version checks that are not necessary, because the
   minSdkVersion (or surrounding known API level) is already at least as high
   as the version checked for.

   Similarly, it also looks for resources in -vNN folders, such as values-v14
   where the version qualifier is less than or equal to the minSdkVersion,
   where the contents should be merged into the best folder.

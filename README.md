# AgriConnect: Blockchain & Social Platform for Agriculture

AgriConnect is a comprehensive mobile application designed to empower farmers and enhance the agricultural supply chain through technology. It combines robust product traceability features with a vibrant social community platform, focusing on transparency, knowledge sharing, and community building.

## Project Overview

This application aims to provide:
-   **Complete Product Traceability:** From farm to consumer, track every step of a product's journey.
-   **Secure Transfer & Verification:** Ensure product authenticity and ownership through secure protocols, including blockchain integration.
-   **Active Social Community:** A platform for farmers to connect, share knowledge, discuss best practices, and build networks.
-   **Content & Engagement:** Tools for live content, event management, mentorship, and recognition to foster an engaged community.

## Core Features

The application is structured around four main pillars:

### 1. Traceability System
Screens and functionalities enabling detailed tracking and verification of agricultural products.
-   **ProductTraceabilityScreen:** Visualizes the complete supply chain for a given product.
-   **QRCodeGeneratorScreen:** Allows users (e.g., farmers, processors) to generate QR codes for product labeling and easy tracking.
-   **VerificationWorkflowScreen:** Manages multi-step verification processes for products (e.g., quality checks, inspections).
-   **CertificationManagementScreen:** Allows uploading, viewing, and managing quality certificates and compliance documents associated with products or entities.
-   **BlockchainIntegrationScreen:** Provides an interface to view and (simulate) writing records to an immutable blockchain ledger for critical traceability events.

### 2. Transfer & Verification Protocols
Secure mechanisms for transferring product ownership and verifying authenticity.
-   **TransferScreen:** Facilitates the secure transfer of product ownership between parties.
-   **VerificationRequestScreen:** Allows users to request third-party verification for products (e.g., from certification bodies).
-   **OwnershipHistoryScreen:** Displays the complete chain of ownership for a product.
-   **TransferVerificationScreen:** Manages the confirmation of transfers, potentially involving digital signatures or multi-factor authentication (simulated).
-   **ComplianceTrackingScreen:** Monitors and displays adherence to regulatory requirements for products or entities.

### 3. Social Community Platform
Features designed to foster networking, knowledge sharing, and community among farmers.
-   **SocialFeedScreen:** An infinitely scrolling feed for community posts, updates, and engagement (likes, comments).
-   **CommunityGroupsScreen:** Allows users to discover, join, and participate in topic-specific or regional farmer groups. (Group creation stubbed).
-   **PostCreationScreen:** Enables users to create multimedia posts (text, simulated image/location tagging) for the social feed or to initiate group creation.
-   **DiscussionForumScreen:** Provides a space for topic-based discussions, either as comments on posts or as threads within community groups.
-   **KnowledgeSharingScreen:** A hub for accessing articles, videos, guides, and expert advice on agricultural best practices.

### 4. Content & Engagement Tools
Mechanisms for real-time content, events, mentorship, and recognition.
-   **LiveStreamingScreen:** (Simulated) Platform for users to host or view live streams (e.g., farm tours, Q&A sessions). Includes mock chat functionality.
-   **EventManagementScreen:** Lists agricultural events, workshops, and conferences, allowing users to RSVP (simulated).
-   **MentorshipScreen:** Facilitates connections between experienced mentors and mentees within the agricultural community. Users can find and request mentorship.
-   **AchievementSystemScreen:** Recognizes user participation and milestones through badges and points.
-   **NewsAndUpdatesScreen:** Delivers relevant agricultural news, market updates, and platform announcements.

## Technology Stack (Conceptual for this Mock Implementation)

-   **Frontend:** React Native
-   **Navigation:** React Navigation (Stack & Bottom Tabs)
-   **State Management:** (Not explicitly defined, but React Context or Redux could be used)
-   **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet
-   **Blockchain Interaction (Simulated):** Mock objects representing blockchain calls. Real implementation would use libraries like ethers.js or web3.js.
-   **Live Streaming (Simulated):** UI mockups. Real implementation would require native media libraries (e.g., react-native-webrtc, react-native-nodemediaclient) and backend infrastructure.

## Getting Started (Conceptual)

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install` or `yarn install`
3.  **Link native dependencies (if any):** `npx react-native link` (especially for libraries like vector icons, image picker, geolocation if fully implemented).
4.  **Run the application:**
    *   For iOS: `npx react-native run-ios`
    *   For Android: `npx react-native run-android`

```

## Navigation

The application uses a bottom tab navigator for main sections:
-   **Traceability:** Stack navigator for all traceability-related screens.
-   **Transfer:** Stack navigator for transfer and verification screens.
-   **Social:** Stack navigator for feed, groups, knowledge sharing, post creation, and discussion forums.
-   **Engage:** Stack navigator for news, events, live streams, mentorship, and achievements.

Individual screens within these stacks handle specific functionalities. Some screens (e.g., `PostCreationScreen`, `DiscussionForumScreen`) are part of a stack but might be navigated to contextually from various points in the app.

## Mock Data and APIs

All dynamic content and backend interactions in this version are simulated using mock data and functions within each relevant screen file. This allows for UI development and testing without a live backend. For a production application, these would be replaced with actual API calls.

## Future Enhancements (Conceptual)

-   Full backend integration for data persistence and real-time features.
-   Implementation of actual blockchain interactions.
-   Native modules for live streaming, image/video processing, and advanced geolocation.
-   Robust user authentication and authorization.
-   Push notifications for updates, messages, and event reminders.
-   Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, E2E).
-   UI/UX refinement and theming.
-   Accessibility improvements.
-   Localization for different regions/languages.

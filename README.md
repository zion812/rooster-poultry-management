## üéØ Current Development Focus & Goals

**Primary Objective: Functional Application Showcase for Fundraising**

The current development phase is centered on producing a compelling and functional showcase of the Rooster app's capabilities. This showcase is intended for presentations to potential investors and stakeholders to secure funding for further development and full-scale deployment.

**Key Considerations for this Phase:**

*   **Feature Completeness for Demonstration:** All core and differentiating features (Farm Management, Marketplace, Community, Auctions, Price Prediction) are being built out in the codebase to demonstrate the full potential of the application.
*   **Payment Gateway Integration (Deferred Live Transactions):** While the application is designed to integrate with payment gateways like Razorpay, and the necessary backend logic and UI flows are being implemented, **live payment transactions are currently deferred.** This is due to the unavailability of live API keys during this pre-funding stage. Payment flows will be demonstrable (e.g., using stubs, mock data, or test modes if available from the gateway) to illustrate the user experience. The system is architected for straightforward activation of live payments once API keys are procured.
*   **Free-Tier Optimization:** Development and demonstration will primarily utilize the free tiers of backend services like Firebase and Back4app (Parse). This necessitates careful consideration of resource usage (data storage, API calls, function invocations) to ensure the showcase remains sustainable. Design choices should also allow for easy scaling to paid tiers post-funding.

## üì± Mobile App Architecture

The Android app follows a Clean Architecture approach with three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer** (Jetpack Compose + MVVM)
  - Screens and UI components organized under `com.example.rooster.ui.screens`
  - Navigation via `com.rooster.app.navigation.NavigationRoute`
  - State management with ViewModels annotated `@HiltViewModel`
  - Dependency Injection with Hilt (`App` application class)
  - Charting with MPAndroidChart for data visualization

2. **Domain Layer**
  - Use-cases encapsulated in `:
    - `core-common` for business logic utilities
    - `core-network` for repository abstractions

3. **Data Layer** (Firebase + Room Hybrid)
  - **Network**: Retrofit + Parse SDK for remote APIs, including Gson for JSON processing
  - **Database**: Room for offline caching and persistence
  - **Synchronization**: WorkManager jobs for background sync

---

## üí≥ **Payment Integration**

The application is designed to integrate with the **Razorpay Payment Gateway** for secure and efficient payment processing. The backend (`backend/services/razorpayService.js`) includes logic for creating Razorpay orders and verifying payment signatures.

**Current Status:** The end-to-end payment flow is being implemented within the app and backend. However, **live transactions are deferred** pending the availability of live Razorpay API keys. For showcase purposes, payment steps may be simulated or use test credentials where possible. The system is architected for easy activation of live payments once keys are available.

## üìÅ Core Modules

### core-common (Deep Dive)

The `core-common` module is a foundational library providing shared utilities, constants, data models, interfaces, and enums utilized across all other modules in the application. Its primary goal is to ensure consistency, reduce boilerplate, and define common contracts.

**Key Components within `com.example.rooster.core.common`:**

1.  **Core Utilities & Contracts:**
    *   **`Constants.kt`**: A comprehensive collection of centralized app-wide constants. This includes application metadata, network configurations (timeouts, retries), Parse server details, cache settings, UI parameters (animation durations, debounce delays), pagination defaults, date/time formats, validation rules (e.g., password length), file upload constraints (size, types, compression quality), notification channel IDs, SharedPreferences keys, standardized error/success messages, rural optimization parameters (e.g., RAM thresholds, specific network timeouts), feature flags, language codes (English, Telugu), and domain-specific constants for Marketplace, Social, and Farm Management features. It also defines nested objects for `Routes`, `IntentActions`, and `BundleKeys`.
    *   **`Extensions.kt`**: A rich set of Kotlin extension functions for various standard types (String, Long, Date, List, Double, Int) and Android classes (Context). These provide convenient helpers for tasks like string manipulation, date formatting, network availability checks, safe API call execution (wrapping calls in `Result<T>`), currency formatting, dimension conversions (dp/px), and input validation (email, phone number).
    *   **`Result.kt`**: Implements a sealed interface `Result<out T>` (with `Success<T>`, `Error(Throwable)`, and `Loading` states) for robustly handling asynchronous operations and their outcomes. It includes useful extension functions for processing results and converting `Flows` to `Flow<Result<T>>`.
    *   **`UserIdProvider.kt`**: An interface (`UserIdProvider`) defining a contract for accessing the current authenticated user's ID, both synchronously (`getCurrentUserId()`) and reactively (`currentUserIdFlow: Flow<String?>`).
    *   **`ImageUploadService.kt`**: An interface (`ImageUploadService`) defining contracts for uploading single or multiple images (from `Uri`s). It includes `ImageCompressionOptions` for specifying image processing parameters before upload. This service is crucial for features handling user-generated image content.

2.  **Domain-Specific Interfaces (Repositories):**
    *   **`domain/repository/PaymentRepository.kt`**: Defines the interface for payment operations, abstracting interactions with payment gateways (e.g., Razorpay via a backend). Includes methods like `createRazorpayOrder` and `verifyRazorpayPayment`.
    *   **`domain/repository/TokenRepository.kt`**: Defines the interface for managing a user's token balance (potentially an in-app currency or credit system). Includes methods for loading balance, and deducting/adding tokens.

3.  **Event Handling:**
    *   **`event/AppEventBus.kt`**: A singleton event bus implemented with Kotlin `SharedFlow` for decoupled app-wide communication. Currently provides a flow for `PaymentEvent`.
    *   **`event/PaymentEvent.kt`**: A sealed class representing specific payment-related events, particularly for handling results from payment gateways like Razorpay (`Success`, `Failure`).

4.  **Shared Data Models & Enums (DTOs):**
    *   All models and enums intended for serialization are annotated with `@Serializable` for use with `kotlinx.serialization`.
    *   **General Models (`models/`):**
        *   `ValidationResult.kt`: A simple data class to convey the outcome of validation operations.
        *   `BidStatistics.kt`: Data class for holding aggregated statistics about bids.
    *   **Auction-Specific Models (`models/auction/`):**
        *   `AuctionListing.kt`: Comprehensive DTO for auction item details.
        *   `AuctionWinner.kt`: DTO for auction winner information.
        *   `BackupBidder.kt`: DTO for backup bidder details.
        *   `EnhancedAuctionBid.kt`: Detailed DTO for individual bids.
    *   **Payment-Specific Models (`models/payment/`):**
        *   `CreateOrderRequest.kt`: DTO for requesting payment order creation.
        *   `RazorpayOrderResponse.kt`: DTO for the backend's response when a Razorpay order is created.
        *   `VerifyPaymentRequest.kt`: DTO for requesting payment verification.
        *   `VerifyPaymentResponse.kt`: DTO for the backend's response after payment verification.
        *   `PaymentVerificationData.kt`: DTO containing details of a verified payment.
    *   **Enums (`enums/`):** A collection of enums crucial for defining states and categories, primarily for auction and payment processes:
        *   `AuctionPaymentStatus.kt`
        *   `AuctionStatus.kt`
        *   `BidMonitoringCategory.kt`
        *   `BidStatus.kt`
        *   `DepositStatus.kt`
        *   `OfferResponse.kt`

This module ensures consistency, promotes code reuse, and provides common building blocks essential for the functioning of various features across the Rooster application.

### core-network (Deep Dive)

The `core-network` module is responsible for all remote data interactions, providing a robust and configurable networking layer. It handles API client setup, request/response processing, authentication, error handling, and repository implementations for network-bound data.

**Key Components within `com.example.rooster.core.network`:**

1.  **Networking Setup (`NetworkModule.kt`):**
    *   **Hilt Module:** Centralizes the provision of all networking dependencies.
    *   **OkHttpClient:** A highly configured client including:
        *   `HttpLoggingInterceptor`: For detailed request/response logging during development.
        *   `AuthInterceptor`: Injects necessary headers like "Content-Type", "User-Agent", and importantly, the "Authorization" (Bearer token) header by fetching the token from `TokenProvider`.
        *   `NetworkInterceptor`: Adds "Cache-Control" headers to responses, aiding in rural network optimization.
        *   `TokenAuthenticator`: An OkHttp `Authenticator` that handles 401 Unauthorized responses by attempting to refresh the Firebase authentication token via `TokenProvider` and then retrying the request.
        *   HTTP Cache: Configured for caching responses to reduce network load.
        *   Standard Timeouts: Connection, read, and write timeouts.
        *   Retry on Connection Failure: Enabled by default.
    *   **Retrofit Instances:** Provides multiple, distinctly qualified Retrofit instances:
        *   `@ParseRetrofit`: For communication with the Parse Server backend (`Constants.PARSE_SERVER_URL`).
        *   `@PaymentApiRetrofit`: For the payment-specific API, with its base URL dynamically provided via Hilt (`@PaymentApiBaseUrl` qualifier, sourced from `BuildConfig`).
        *   `@GeneralRetrofit`: A placeholder for a general-purpose API (currently points to `https://api.rooster.com/v1/`).
    *   **Serialization:** All Retrofit instances are configured to use `kotlinx.serialization` for JSON processing, utilizing a shared, lenient `Json` configuration.
    *   **API Service Provision:** Provides `PaymentApiService` for interacting with payment-related backend endpoints.

2.  **Authentication Handling:**
    *   **`TokenProvider.kt`**: Defines an interface (`TokenProvider`) and its implementation (`FirebaseTokenProvider`) responsible for fetching the Firebase ID token, with an option to force refresh.
    *   **`TokenAuthenticator.kt`**: Works in tandem with OkHttpClient to automatically refresh expired tokens upon receiving a 401 error.

3.  **Network Utilities & Error Handling (`NetworkUtils.kt`):**
    *   **`NetworkError` Sealed Class:** Defines a hierarchy of custom, structured network error types (e.g., `NoInternet`, `Timeout`, `ServerError`, `ClientError`) to provide more specific error information than raw exceptions.
    *   `Throwable.toNetworkError()`: An extension function to convert standard exceptions (like `HttpException`, `IOException`) into the custom `NetworkError` types.
    *   `safeNetworkCall { ... }`: A suspend function that wraps network calls, automatically catching exceptions and returning them as `Result.Error` containing a `NetworkError`.
    *   `Flow<T>.asNetworkResult()`: An extension for Kotlin Flows to transform them into `Flow<Result<T>>`, where errors are mapped to `NetworkError`.
    *   `NetworkRetryStrategy`: A class providing a utility (`retryWithBackoff`) for implementing exponential backoff retry logic for network operations.
    *   (Note: `NetworkConnectivityChecker` interface and `NetworkAnalyticsInterceptor` are also defined here but their implementations or active usage are outside this module or not yet fully integrated.)

4.  **Repository Implementations (`repository/`):**
    *   **`ParseTokenRepositoryImpl.kt`**: Implements the `TokenRepository` interface (from `core-common`). It interacts with Parse Cloud functions (`deductUserTokens`, `addUserTokens`) for managing user token balances and fetches the balance from the Parse User object.
    *   **`RazorpayPaymentRepositoryImpl.kt`**: Implements the `PaymentRepository` interface (from `core-common`). It uses the `PaymentApiService` (Retrofit service) to communicate with the backend for creating Razorpay orders and verifying payments. It handles API responses and errors, wrapping outcomes in the `Result` type.

5.  **Retrofit Service Interfaces (`retrofit/`):**
    *   **`PaymentApiService.kt`**: Defines the Retrofit interface for payment-related API calls to the application's backend, such as creating orders and verifying payments.

6.  **Dependency Injection (`di/`, `qualifiers/`):**
    *   Provides Hilt modules (`PaymentRepositoryModule`, `TokenRepositoryModule`) to bind repository implementations to their interfaces.
    *   Defines custom Hilt qualifiers like `@PaymentApiBaseUrl` for injecting specific configurations (e.g., the base URL for the payment API).

This module establishes a resilient, configurable, and observable networking layer, crucial for data exchange with backend services, with built-in support for authentication, structured error handling, and consideration for rural network conditions.

### Other Core Libraries

Brief overview of other specialized core modules:

*   **`core:navigation`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Provides the foundational structure for Jetpack Compose navigation within the app.
    *   **Key Components**:
        *   `AppScreens`: A sealed class defining top-level navigation routes, including routes that point to feature-specific subgraphs (e.g., `FarmFeature`, `MarketplaceFeature`).
        *   `AppNavHost`: A composable function that sets up the main `NavHost`. It's designed to be extensible, allowing feature modules to contribute their nested navigation graphs via a `graphBuilder` lambda. This promotes a modular design where the `:app` module typically assembles the complete navigation graph.
    *   **Strategy**: Facilitates a decoupled navigation system where features manage their own internal routes, and `core:navigation` provides the contracts and the main container.

*   **`core:search`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Defines contracts and a placeholder for a global search functionality.
    *   **Key Components**:
        *   `SearchResultItem`: A data class representing a generic search result item.
        *   `SearchRepository`: An interface defining how search operations are performed (returning a `Flow<Result<List<SearchResultItem>>>`).
        *   `PlaceholderSearchRepository`: A basic, Hilt-injectable placeholder implementation that simulates search operations. A full implementation would query various data sources (local database, network APIs).
    *   **Strategy**: Establishes the data structures and repository pattern for a consistent search experience. Feature modules or the `:app` module would integrate with this repository to provide search capabilities.

*   **`core:analytics`**:
    *   **Purpose**: Offers an abstraction layer for analytics tracking, currently implemented using Firebase Analytics.
    *   **Key Components**:
        *   `AnalyticsService`: An interface defining common analytics operations like `logEvent` and `setUserProperty`.
        *   `FirebaseAnalyticsService`: An implementation of `AnalyticsService` that interacts with Firebase Analytics. It includes helpers for event/property name sanitization to comply with Firebase conventions.
        *   `AnalyticsModule`: A Hilt module for providing the `AnalyticsService` implementation.
    *   **Strategy**: Decouples analytics logging from specific provider SDKs, allowing for easier maintenance or future changes to the analytics backend.

## üß© Feature Modules

### feature-farm (Deep Dive)

The `feature-farm` module provides a comprehensive suite of tools for poultry farm management, emphasizing offline-first capabilities, data synchronization, and detailed record-keeping including flock lineage.

**1. Data Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.farm.data`)**

*   **Local Persistence (`data.local`):**
    *   **`FarmDatabase`**: A Room database (version 3) storing all local farm-related data. It includes entities like `FlockEntity`, `MortalityEntity`, `VaccinationEntity`, `SensorDataEntity`, `UpdateEntity`, and `LineageLinkEntity`. Most entities feature a `needsSync: Boolean` flag to track offline changes.
    *   **DAOs**:
        *   `FlockDao`: For CRUD operations on `FlockEntity` and fetching unsynced flocks.
        *   `MortalityDao`, `VaccinationDao`, `SensorDataDao`, `UpdateDao`: For CRUD operations on their respective entities.
        *   `LineageDao`: For CRUD operations on `LineageLinkEntity` (parent-child relationships).
    *   **`FarmDatabaseMigrations`**: Provides migrations for database schema evolution (e.g., adding `needsSync` columns, creating the `lineage_links` table).
    *   **Type Converters**: Defined in `FarmLocalDataSource.kt` for custom types used in Room entities (e.g., List<String>, RelationshipType).
*   **Remote Data Source (`data.remote`):**
    *   **`FirebaseFarmDataSource`**: Handles all communication with Firebase services (Firestore and Realtime Database).
        *   Stores flock data in Firestore (`flocks_v2`) and Realtime Database (`flocks_v2`).
        *   Stores lineage links in Firestore (`lineage_links`).
        *   Provides real-time data streams using `callbackFlow` for various data types.
        *   Handles saving and deleting farm-related data to Firebase.
*   **Repositories (`data.repository`):**
    *   **`FarmRepositoryImpl`**: Implements `FarmRepository`. It orchestrates data flow between local (DAOs) and remote (`FirebaseFarmDataSource`) sources. Key responsibilities include:
        *   Fetching combined local/remote data for single flocks.
        *   Registering new flocks (local save with `needsSync=true`, then attempts remote save).
        *   Managing `needsSync` flags when caching remote data or creating local data.
        *   Implementing lineage logic: `getLineageInfo` recursively builds ancestor and descendant trees using `LineageDao` and `FlockDao`. Handles adding/removing parent-child links with local and remote persistence.
    *   Implementations for `MortalityRepository`, `SensorDataRepository`, `VaccinationRepository`, `UpdateRepository` (though not detailed here, they follow a similar pattern of interacting with their respective DAOs and potentially `FirebaseFarmDataSource`).

**2. Domain Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.farm.domain`)**

*   **Models (`domain.model`):** Rich Kotlin data classes representing the business objects:
    *   `Flock`: Detailed model for individual birds/flocks, including properties for identification, verification, health, lineage, etc. and associated enums (`FlockType`, `AgeGroup`, `Gender`, etc.).
    *   `FarmDetails`: Model for overall farm information, statistics, and compliance.
    *   `FlockRegistrationData`: DTO for registering new flocks, supporting traceable and non-traceable types.
    *   `LineageNode` & `LineageInfo`: Models for representing flock lineage trees.
    *   `MortalityRecord`, `SensorData`, `UpdateRecord`, `VaccinationRecord`: Models for specific farm events and data points.
*   **Use Cases (`domain.usecase`):** Encapsulate specific business logic operations, interacting with repositories. Examples include:
    *   `GetFarmDetailsUseCase`, `GetFlocksByTypeUseCase`, `RegisterFlockUseCase`.
    *   `GetFamilyTreeUseCase` (provides lineage, though `FarmRepository.getLineageInfo` is more comprehensive).
    *   Use cases for managing mortality, sensor data, updates, and vaccinations (Get, Save, Delete operations).

**3. Presentation Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.farm.ui`)**

*   **Structure**: Organized into sub-packages for different farm management aspects (e.g., `board`, `details`, `lineage`, `mortality`, `registry`, `vaccination`). Each typically contains a Composable screen and a Hilt ViewModel.
*   **Key Screens & ViewModels:**
    *   **`FarmMainScreen` / `FarmMainViewModel`**: Acts as a central dashboard or hub for the farm feature, displaying summary cards and providing navigation to various sub-sections.
    *   **`FlockRegistryScreen` / `FlockRegistryViewModel`**: UI for registering new flocks.
    *   **`FlockLineageScreen` / `FlockLineageViewModel`**: UI for visualizing flock lineage by recursively displaying parent and child nodes.
    *   Screens for `FarmBoard` (listing flocks by type), `FarmDetails` (basic display), `Mortality`, `Updates`, `Vaccination`, `Growth` (chart placeholders), `Monitoring`.
*   **Navigation (`navigation` and `ui/navigation`):**
    *   `feature/farm/navigation/FarmNavigation.kt`: Defines `FarmScreens` (routes) and a `farmFeatureGraph` extension function intended for integration into the main app's navigation graph. Uses `PlaceholderScreen`s that need to be wired to actual feature screens or the `FarmMainScreen`.
    *   `feature/farm/ui/navigation/FarmNavGraph.kt`: Defines `FarmRoutes` and a `FarmNavGraph` composable that creates its own `NavHost` and `NavController`. This seems to manage internal navigation within the farm feature, likely hosted or used by `FarmMainScreen`. *The use of a separate NavHost here compared to the graph builder function presents a point of potential architectural review for cleaner integration.*
    *   `FarmState.kt`: Defines UI state classes (`FarmState`, `FlockStats`) used by `FarmMainViewModel`.

**4. Dependency Injection (`com.example.rooster.feature.farm.di`)**

*   **`FarmModule.kt`**: Contains Hilt modules (`FarmBindsModule`, `FarmProvidesModule`).
    *   `FarmProvidesModule`: Provides `FarmDatabase` (configured with migrations), all DAOs (`FlockDao`, `LineageDao`, etc.), `FirebaseFirestore`, and `DatabaseReference`.
    *   `FarmBindsModule`: Binds repository interfaces (`FarmRepository`, etc.) and use case interfaces to their implementations.

**5. Background Worker (`com.example.rooster.feature.farm.worker`)**

*   **`FarmDataSyncWorker`**: A `HiltWorker` responsible for syncing locally created/modified farm data (currently `FlockEntity`) to Firebase.
    *   It queries `FlockDao` for entities with `needsSync = true`.
    *   Uploads them via `FirebaseFarmDataSource`.
    *   Updates the `needsSync` flag to `false` in the local database upon successful remote persistence.
    *   Includes mappers (simpler than repository's) for entity-to-remote conversion.

This module is a cornerstone of the application, providing deep and robust farm management capabilities with a strong focus on offline support and data integrity through synchronization.

### feature-marketplace (Deep Dive)

The `feature-marketplace` module allows users to browse, list, and purchase products, primarily focusing on poultry and related agricultural items. It supports offline caching of product listings and orders, and synchronization of user-generated content like new listings and orders.

**1. Data Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.marketplace.data`)**

*   **Local Persistence (`data.local`):**
    *   **`MarketplaceDatabase`**: A Room database (version 1) for caching marketplace data. Entities include `ProductListingEntity`, `CartItemEntity` (local-only), `OrderEntity`, and `OrderItemEntity`.
    *   **DAOs**: `ProductListingDao`, `CartDao`, `OrderDao` provide CRUD operations and specific queries (e.g., for unsynced items).
    *   **Entities**: `ProductListingEntity` and `OrderEntity` include a `needsSync: Boolean` flag for offline modifications. `CartItemEntity` is treated as local-only.
    *   **`MarketplaceTypeConverters`**: Handles conversion for complex types like lists, maps, enums, and `PaymentDetails` (stored as JSON).
    *   **Note**: The database currently uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()`. Proper migrations should be implemented for future schema changes.
*   **Remote Data Source (`data.remote`):**
    *   **`FirebaseMarketplaceDataSource`**: Implements `MarketplaceRemoteDataSource`. Interacts with Firestore collections (`marketplace_listings`, `marketplace_orders`) for creating, reading, updating, and deleting listings and orders.
    *   **Pagination**: `getProductListingsStream` supports cursor-based pagination using `limit()` and `startAfter()` for efficient loading of product lists.
*   **Repositories (`data.repository`):**
    *   **`ProductListingRepositoryImpl`**: Manages product listing data, implementing a network-bound resource pattern. It fetches data from local Room cache first, then updates from `FirebaseMarketplaceDataSource`. Handles `needsSync` logic for listings created or updated offline.
    *   **`OrderRepositoryImpl`**: Manages order data with a similar network-bound resource strategy. Handles `needsSync` for orders created offline.
    *   **`CartRepositoryImpl`**: Manages cart data. Currently, it's implemented as a local-only repository interacting solely with `CartDao`.

**2. Domain Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.marketplace.domain`)**

*   **Models (`domain.model`):** Defines core business objects like `ProductListing`, `CartItem`, `Order`, `OrderItem`, `ShippingAddress`, `PaymentDetails`, `SellerProfile`, and related enums (`ProductCategory`, `ListingStatus`, `OrderStatus`, `PaymentStatus`). All models are `@Serializable`.
*   **Repository Interfaces (`domain.repository`):** Defines contracts (`ProductListingRepository`, `CartRepository`, `OrderRepository`) that the data layer repositories implement.

**3. Presentation Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.marketplace.ui`)**

*   **Structure**: Organized into sub-packages for different marketplace sections like `productlist`, `productdetail`, `createlisting`, and `cart`.
*   **Key Screens & ViewModels:**
    *   **`ProductListScreen` / `ProductListViewModel`**: Displays product listings in a grid with support for pagination (infinite scroll).
    *   **`ProductDetailScreen` / `ProductDetailViewModel`**: Shows detailed information about a selected product and allows adding to cart. Uses Accompanist Pager for image gallery.
    *   **`CreateListingScreen` / `CreateListingViewModel`**: Provides a form for users to create new product listings. Integrates with `ImageUploadService` (from `core-common`, implemented in `:app` module) for handling image selection and uploads to Firebase Storage.
    *   **`CartScreen` / `CartViewModel`**: Displays items in the user's cart, allowing quantity updates and item removal. Manages cart state locally.
    *   **`MarketplaceScreen.kt`**: Currently a placeholder, intended as the main entry/wrapper for the marketplace feature.
*   **Image Handling**: Uses Coil for displaying images and relies on `ImageUploadService` for uploads during listing creation.

**4. Dependency Injection (`com.example.rooster.feature.marketplace.di`)**

*   **`MarketplaceModule.kt`**: Contains Hilt modules (`MarketplaceProvidesModule`, `MarketplaceBindsModule`) to provide `MarketplaceDatabase`, DAOs, `Gson`, and bind repository/data source implementations.

**Key Features & Considerations:**

*   **Offline Support**: Product listings and orders are cached locally using Room and support offline creation/modification via `needsSync` flags. The cart is currently local-only.
*   **Pagination**: Product lists are loaded page by page to improve performance and reduce data usage.
*   **Image Upload**: New listings support image uploads, which are handled by a core `ImageUploadService`.
*   **Synchronization**: While `needsSync` flags are present, dedicated `WorkManager` workers for marketplace data (similar to `FarmDataSyncWorker`) are not explicitly detailed in the current code but would be the standard pattern for robust background sync. Repositories handle immediate sync attempts.

### feature-community (Deep Dive)

The `feature-community` module provides social interaction capabilities, allowing users to create profiles, make posts, and comment. It's built with offline support for creating content.

**1. Data Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.community.data`)**

*   **Local Persistence (`data.local`):**
    *   **`CommunityDatabase`**: A Room database (version 1) for caching community-related data. Entities include `CommunityUserProfileEntity`, `PostEntity`, and `CommentEntity`.
    *   **DAOs**: `CommunityUserProfileDao`, `PostDao`, `CommentDao` for CRUD operations and fetching unsynced items.
    *   **Entities**: All entities (`CommunityUserProfileEntity`, `PostEntity`, `CommentEntity`) include a `needsSync: Boolean` flag for offline content creation and updates.
    *   **`CommunityTypeConverters`**: Handles `List<String>` conversion (e.g., for tags, mentions, interests).
    *   **Note**: The database currently uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()`. Proper migrations are needed for future schema changes.
*   **Remote Data Source (`data.remote`):**
    *   **`FirebaseCommunityDataSource`**: Implements `CommunityRemoteDataSource`. Interacts with Firestore collections (`community_user_profiles`, `community_posts`, `community_comments`).
    *   Provides real-time streams for profiles, posts (with basic filtering by `FeedType`), and comments.
    *   Handles CUD operations for profiles, posts, and comments.
    *   **TODOs**: Current implementation has placeholders for like/unlike functionality, pagination for feeds/comments, and robust logic for 'FOLLOWING' feed type. Updating denormalized counts (e.g., post likes/comments) is also noted as needing server-side transactions or Cloud Functions.
*   **Repositories (`data.repository`):**
    *   `CommunityUserProfileRepositoryImpl`, `PostRepositoryImpl`, `CommentRepositoryImpl`: Implement their respective domain interfaces.
    *   Employ a network-bound resource pattern (using `localBackedCommunityResource` helpers) to combine local Room data with remote Firestore data.
    *   Handle `needsSync` logic for offline-created/updated content, attempting immediate remote sync and relying on the flag if remote fails.

**2. Domain Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.community.domain`)**

*   **Models (`domain.model`):** Defines `@Serializable` domain objects: `CommunityUserProfile`, `Post`, `Comment`, and `ReactionType` (enum for future richer reactions).
*   **Repository Interfaces (`domain.repository`):** Defines contracts (`CommunityUserProfileRepository`, `PostRepository`, `CommentRepository`) including methods for fetching different `FeedType`s of posts.

**3. Presentation Layer (`com.example.rooster.feature.community.ui`)**

*   **Key Screens & ViewModels:**
    *   **`CreatePostScreen` / `CreatePostViewModel`**: UI for creating text-only posts. Uses `UserIdProvider` for author ID. (Image/video uploads are future enhancements).
    *   **`PostFeedScreen` / `PostFeedViewModel`**: Displays a list of posts using `PostItem`. Supports basic feed type filtering (Global Recent).
    *   **`PostItem`**: Composable for rendering individual posts, including author info, content, and placeholders for like/comment/share actions. Supports image display using Accompanist Pager.
    *   **`CommunityProfileScreen` / `CommunityProfileViewModel`**: Displays user community profiles. Includes placeholders for listing user's posts.
*   **TODOs**: Many UI interactions (likes, creating comments, sharing), advanced feed filtering, and full image/video support in post creation are noted as future work.

**4. Dependency Injection (`com.example.rooster.feature.community.di`)**

*   **`CommunityModule.kt`**: Provides `CommunityDatabase`, DAOs, and binds repository/data source implementations.
*   **Note**: Repository bindings were commented out in the reviewed file version but are assumed active based on `AGENTS.MD`.

**Key Features & Considerations:**

*   **Offline Content Creation**: Users can create profiles, posts, and comments offline, which are then synced.
*   **Basic Social Features**: Provides the foundation for viewing posts, user profiles, and creating text posts.
*   **Incomplete Features**: Significant parts of a full social experience (rich media posts, liking, commenting, notifications, advanced feeds) are currently placeholders or TODOs.
*   **Synchronization**: Relies on repository-level sync attempts and `needsSync` flags. No dedicated `WorkManager` for community data sync was observed, which might be needed for more robust background synchronization of larger data or media.

## üì± Application Module (`:app`)

The `:app` module serves as the main entry point for the Android application and is responsible for orchestrating the overall application lifecycle, navigation, and integration of core and feature modules.

**Key Responsibilities & Components:**

1.  **Application Class (`App.kt`):**
    *   Annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp` to enable Hilt dependency injection throughout the application.
    *   Implements `Configuration.Provider` to provide a custom `WorkManager` configuration, injecting `HiltWorkerFactory` for DI in background workers.
    *   **Initializes Parse SDK:** Configures and initializes the Parse SDK with application ID, client key, and server URL. Registers ParseObject subclasses (e.g., `MarketplaceListingParse`, `ChatParse`). Enables local datastore for Parse, crucial for offline capabilities related to Parse data.
    *   **Initializes Firebase Services:** Sets up Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics.
    *   **Schedules Background Workers:** Enqueues `FarmDataSyncWorker` (from `feature-farm`) for periodic farm data synchronization and a generic `DataSyncWorker` (incomplete, potentially for Parse data).
    *   **Manages `PhotoUploadDatabase`:** Initializes a Room database (`rooster_photo_uploads.db`) for managing photo uploads and messages. Note: This database uses `fallbackToDestructiveMigration` and a static singleton access pattern.
    *   Includes memory optimization and crash prevention utilities.

2.  **Main Activity (`MainActivity.kt`):**
    *   The primary entry point for the UI, annotated with `@AndroidEntryPoint`.
    *   **Navigation Host:** Sets up the main navigation graph using `AppNavHost` (from `core:navigation`). It determines the start destination based on authentication state (`AuthViewModel`) and user roles.
    *   **Feature Module Integration:** Integrates navigation graphs from feature modules (e.g., `farmFeatureGraph` from `feature-farm`, `auctionsFeatureGraph` from `feature-auctions`) into the main `AppNavHost`.
    *   **Payment Callbacks:** Implements Razorpay's `PaymentResultListener` and uses an `AppEventBus` to communicate payment outcomes.
    *   **Legacy Routes:** Contains definitions for many Composable routes that are not yet fully migrated into dedicated feature modules.

3.  **Dependency Injection (`di/AppModule.kt`, `di/AuthBindsModule.kt`):**
    *   Provides application-level dependencies using Hilt.
    *   **`AppModule`**: Provides instances like `FirebaseStorage`, `PaymentApiBaseUrl` (from `BuildConfig`), and various repositories (some concrete, some via interface binding).
    *   **`AuthBindsModule`**: Binds implementations for `UserIdProvider` (`FirebaseUserIdProvider`) and `ImageUploadService` (`FirebaseStorageImageUploadService`). These implementations reside within the `app` module's `data` package (`data/authprovider` and `data/storage` respectively).

4.  **Service Implementations (within `app/src/main/java/com/example/rooster/data`):**
    *   **`FirebaseUserIdProvider`**: Implements the `core.common.user.UserIdProvider` interface using Firebase Authentication to provide the current user's ID.
    *   **`FirebaseStorageImageUploadService`**: Implements the `core.common.storage.ImageUploadService` interface, handling image uploads to Firebase Storage. Includes TODOs for image compression.

5.  **Configuration (`config/Constants.kt`):**
    *   Provides app-specific constants, including actual keys for Back4App (Parse backend), overriding or supplementing constants from `core-common`.

**Overall Role:** The `:app` module is crucial for initializing global services, setting up dependency injection, managing the main navigation flow, and providing concrete implementations for core service interfaces that require application context or specific Firebase service integrations. It also currently hosts UI screens and logic that may eventually be refactored into more specialized feature modules.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend & Cloud Infrastructure

This section details the server-side components, cloud functions, and related infrastructure critical to the Rooster Poultry Management application.

### `backend/` - API Server & Core Services

The `backend/` directory contains a Node.js application built with the Express.js framework. This server acts as a crucial API gateway and service provider for the Rooster mobile application.

**Key Characteristics & Components:**

*   **Technology Stack:** Node.js, Express.js. Key dependencies include `firebase-admin` (for verifying Firebase ID tokens), `parse` (client SDK for Back4App), `razorpay` (for payment processing), `axios`, `joi` (validation), `helmet`, `cors`, `compression`, and `express-rate-limit`.
*   **Main Application (`server.js`):** Initializes the Express app, sets up middleware (security, CORS, compression, rate limiting, request logging with Morgan, body parsing), defines API routes, and includes global error handling.
*   **Authentication (`middleware/auth.js`):**
    *   Implements `authenticateToken` middleware using `firebase-admin` to verify Firebase ID tokens passed in the Authorization header. This secures protected API endpoints.
    *   Provides `optionalAuth` for public routes that might benefit from user context if a token is available.
*   **Services (`services/`):**
    *   **`parseService.js`**: Interacts with a Parse Server backend (Back4App). It makes REST API calls using `axios` to Parse classes (e.g., `_User`, `PoultryPrices`) and Cloud Functions. This service is used for fetching data like historical poultry prices, available regions/fowl types, and potentially for user profile or social content management that resides on Parse.
    *   **`pricePredictor.js`**: Contains the core logic for poultry price prediction. It uses historical data fetched via `parseService` and applies algorithms like moving average and seasonal adjustments.
    *   **`razorpayService.js`**: Wraps the Razorpay Node.js SDK to handle payment operations, including creating orders and verifying payment/webhook signatures.
*   **API Endpoints (defined in `server.js`):**
    *   `/health`: Standard health check.
    *   `/api/regions`, `/api/fowl-types`: Public endpoints to fetch data via `parseService`.
    *   `/api/predict-price`, `/api/market-summary`, `/api/predict-bulk`: Protected endpoints (require Firebase JWT) for price predictions and market summaries, utilizing `pricePredictor` and `parseService`.
    *   `/api/payments/orders` (POST): Protected endpoint to create Razorpay payment orders.
    *   `/api/payments/verify` (POST): Protected endpoint to verify client-side Razorpay payment completion.
    *   `/api/payments/webhook` (POST): Public endpoint (signature verified using webhook secret) to receive and process Razorpay webhook events.
*   **Configuration (`config/translations.js`):** Provides localized (English, Telugu) messages for API responses.
*   **Containerization (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`):** Supports running the backend server in Docker containers.
*   **Role:** This backend serves as an API gateway for specialized tasks like price prediction (which involves custom logic and data from Parse) and payment processing (orchestrating Razorpay). It also acts as an intermediary to the Parse backend for certain data operations.

> **For more detailed information, refer to the `backend/README.md` file.**

### `cloud/` - Parse Cloud Code & Firebase Rules

The `cloud/` directory primarily hosts server-side logic running on a Parse Server environment (Back4App), known as Parse Cloud Code. It also currently contains Firebase security rules files.

**Key Characteristics & Components (Parse Cloud Code):**

*   **Technology Stack:** Node.js, using the Parse JavaScript SDK. Managed with `package.json`.
*   **Main Entry Point (`main.js`):** Defines numerous Cloud Functions critical for application features. This includes:
    *   **Auction System:** Advanced logic for creating "Enhanced Auctions", processing bids, handling auction completion, managing winner payments (interfacing with external payment status updates), and processing bidder deposits/refunds.
    *   **Marketplace Integration:** Functions to create marketplace listings that can optionally be tied to auctions, and to retrieve enhanced listing details including auction status.
    *   **Live Streaming (`liveStreamingFunctions.js`):** Functions to manage live broadcast sessions, including starting/stopping broadcasts, user joining, and a virtual coin/gifting system.
    *   **Token/Coin Management:** Cloud Functions for deducting and adding user "tokens" (virtual currency), including ledgering.
    *   **Utility & Admin Functions:** Includes functions for fetching public bird profiles, market summaries, performance metrics, activity-based farmer verification, and an optimized query function.
    *   **Database Indexing:** Uses `beforeFind` hooks to programmatically attempt to create database indexes on various Parse classes for performance.
    *   **Security:** Implements input sanitization for Cloud Function parameters using `security/sanitizer.js`.
*   **Deployment:** Deployed to Parse Server (Back4App) using the Parse CLI (`parse deploy`).

**Firebase Rules:**

*   The `cloud/` directory also contains `firestore.rules` and `realtime-database.rules.json`.
*   **`firestore.rules`**: Defines security rules for Firestore collections used by features like `feature-farm` (e.g., `flocks`, `mortalityRecords`). These rules generally restrict access to user-owned data.
*   **`realtime-database.rules.json`**: Contains basic rules for Firebase Realtime Database, primarily denying general access with an example for user-specific data.
*   **Note on Placement:** While these Firebase rules are present here, their management and deployment might typically be handled within a Firebase project's root or a dedicated Firebase configuration directory. Their inclusion in the Parse Cloud Code directory should be noted for clarity on deployment processes.

> **For more detailed information on Parse Cloud Code, refer to the `cloud/README.md` file.**

### Firebase & Parse SDK Integration

*   **Firebase:** While the primary backend API resides in `backend/`, Firebase services (Firestore, Realtime Database, Messaging, Analytics, Crashlytics) are used extensively, as mentioned in the mobile app architecture. The `backend/` services may interact with Firebase for data storage, user authentication, or other cloud capabilities.
*   **Parse SDK:** The Parse SDK is utilized for interacting with a Parse Server instance. This is evident from `backend/services/parseService.js` and the structure of the `cloud/` directory, which is typical for Parse Cloud Code. This allows for leveraging Parse Server's database, cloud functions, and other backend-as-a-service features.

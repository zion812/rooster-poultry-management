**Rooster App Brings Digital Transformation to Traditional Poultry Farming with Telugu Language Support and Offline Functionality**

**Hyderabad, India - $(date +"%B %d, %Y")** - Today marks the official launch of Rooster, India's first comprehensive poultry farm management application designed specifically for rural farmers. The app addresses the unique challenges faced by small and medium-scale poultry farmers across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and beyond.

### Bridging the Digital Divide in Agriculture

With over 70% of India's poultry farmers operating small-scale farms in rural areas, access to modern farm management tools has been limited by language barriers, poor internet connectivity, and complex interfaces. Rooster breaks down these barriers with:

- **Complete Telugu language support** for local farmers
- **Offline-first functionality** that works without internet
- **Optimized performance** for low-end smartphones
- **Voice input capabilities** for low-literacy users

### Comprehensive Farm Management Solution

**Analytics & Insights**: Growth tracking, health analytics, and performance metrics to optimize farm productivity.

### Proven Impact on Farmer Livelihoods

Early adoption studies show significant improvements in farm productivity:
- **20% improvement** in record keeping accuracy
- **30% reduction** in disease-related losses
- **40% increase** in market access and sales
- **₹500+ monthly savings** per farmer through optimized operations

Key technical innovations include:
- **2G/3G network optimization** for reliable rural connectivity
- **Minimal data usage** (less than 10MB per day)
- **Battery-efficient design** for all-day usage
- **Support for devices with as little as 1GB RAM**

### Comprehensive Support Infrastructure

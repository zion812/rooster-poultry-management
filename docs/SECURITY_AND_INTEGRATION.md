# Rooster Poultry Management – Security & Integration Overview

---

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Mobile App:** Uses Firebase Auth or JWT for user authentication.
- **Backend:** Verifies JWT/Firebase tokens on protected endpoints.
- **Cloud Functions:** Enforce user roles and permissions via Parse security rules.

---

## 2. Data Privacy & Compliance
- Sensitive data (user info, animal records) is encrypted in transit (HTTPS) and at rest (Firebase/DB).
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase; use `.env` files and secret managers.
- Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.

---

## 3. Rate Limiting & Input Validation
- **Backend:** Uses middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit`, `joi`) to prevent abuse and validate inputs.
- **Cloud:** Validate all user input before processing auction/marketplace actions.

---

## 4. Integration Flows
- **App ↔ Backend:** REST API with token-based auth, JSON payloads.
- **Backend ↔ Cloud:** Event-driven (webhooks, direct API calls), secured via shared secrets or service accounts.
- **Notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for real-time updates.

---

## 5. Security Best Practices
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly.
- Use HTTPS/TLS everywhere.
- Principle of least privilege for all roles and service accounts.
- Log and monitor authentication, errors, and suspicious activity.

---

## 6. TODO / Next Steps
- Document detailed auth flows (diagrams, sequence charts).
- Add automated security scanning to CI pipeline.
- Expand security rules for cloud and backend as needed.
- Review and update privacy policy for compliance.

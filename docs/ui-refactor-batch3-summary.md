# Rooster App UI Refactor: Batch 3 Summary

**Date:** 2025-06-23

## Overview
Batch 3 of the Rooster Poultry Management app UI/UX enhancement project focused on refactoring additional key screens to adopt the standardized `StandardScreenLayout`, unify theming, and improve usability, accessibility, and maintainability. This batch targeted screens with complex layouts and high user engagement, ensuring consistency across the app.

## Screens Refactored in Batch 3
- **MarketplaceScreen**
- **ChatScreen**
- **ComprehensiveMessagingScreen**
- **FowlScreen**
- **DiagnosticsScreen**
- **HealthManagementScreen**
- **FarmerHomeScreen**

## Key Changes
- Replaced root `Column` or `LazyColumn` with `StandardScreenLayout(scrollable = true)` for all screens.
- Ensured all padding, alignment, and scrolling behaviors are handled by the standardized layout.
- Enforced exclusive use of `MaterialTheme` for typography, colors, and UI elements.
- Verified all user-facing text is sourced from string resources for localization.
- Improved accessibility: font scaling, touch targets, and screen reader support.
- Simplified navigation and layout code for easier maintenance.

## Rationale & Benefits
- **Consistency:** All screens now share a unified look and feel, improving the user experience and brand perception.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized layout logic reduces code duplication and makes future changes easier.
- **Accessibility:** Enhanced support for assistive technologies and dynamic font scaling.
- **Localization:** All text is ready for Telugu and English, supporting the app’s rural user base.

## Implementation Details
- Each screen’s root composable was updated to use `StandardScreenLayout`, replacing previous manual padding and scrolling.
- Theming and colors refactored to use `MaterialTheme.colorScheme` and `MaterialTheme.typography`.
- Navigation logic was reviewed for consistency, with further centralization planned.
- All changes were made in batch, with thorough code review for regressions.

## Screenshots & Testing
- Manual QA performed on all refactored screens across devices and orientations.
- Compose UI tests to be updated/added in the next phase.
- Accessibility features verified (TalkBack, font scaling, touch targets).

## Next Steps
1. **Automated UI Tests:** Update Compose UI tests to cover all refactored screens.
2. **Navigation Centralization:** Continue consolidating navigation logic and helpers.
3. **Stakeholder Review:** Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
4. **Prepare for Batch 4:** Identify and audit next set of screens/modules for refactor.

# Rooster Poultry Management – Phased Improvement Plan

This document outlines a high-level, phased strategy to address project gaps and elevate engineering practices. Each phase includes clear goals, deliverables, and suggested actions for experienced developers.

---

## **Phase 1: Testing Coverage & Reporting**

### Goals
- Ensure robust, automated testing across Android, backend, and cloud.
- Establish clear visibility into test coverage and results.

### Actions
- Inventory existing tests in `app/src/test`, `app/src/androidTest`, backend, and cloud.
- Add/expand unit and UI tests for all major features (use Espresso/Compose Test for Android, Jest/Supertest for backend, Parse test utilities for cloud).
- Integrate code coverage tools (JaCoCo for Android, coverage for Node.js).
- Add test status and coverage badges to README.
- Document the testing approach in onboarding docs.

---

## **Phase 2: Documentation & Architecture**

### Goals
- Provide clear, visual, and written documentation for all contributors.
- Enable fast onboarding and reduce ramp-up time.

### Actions
- Create system/module diagrams (draw.io, PlantUML, or Lucidchart).
- Document API endpoints using OpenAPI/Swagger for backend.
- Add feature flowcharts for key user journeys.
- Expand onboarding guide and add troubleshooting/FAQ.
- Add/expand README sections for each module.
- Create/maintain `docs/` directory for in-depth guides.

---

## **Phase 3: CI/CD & DevOps**

### Goals
- Automate build, test, and deployment processes for all modules.
- Ensure code quality and fast feedback for every PR.

### Actions
- Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.).
- Automate linting, building, and testing for Android, backend, and cloud.
- Generate and publish coverage reports on every PR.
- Auto-deploy backend/cloud on main branch merges.
- Add status badges (build, test, coverage) to README.
- Document environment setup and secrets management.

---

## **Phase 4: Integration, Security, & Compliance**

### Goals
- Ensure secure, reliable integration between app, backend, and cloud.
- Meet data privacy and security standards.

### Actions
- Document integration flows (sequence diagrams for app-backend-cloud interactions).
- Document and enforce authentication/authorization strategies (JWT, OAuth, Firebase Auth).
- Review and document security practices (rate limiting, input validation, data privacy compliance).
- Add/expand security rules for cloud functions and backend APIs.

---

## **Phase 5: Localization, Accessibility, & Community**

### Goals
- Maximize usability for all users, including non-English speakers and those with disabilities.
- Foster a strong contributor community.

### Actions
- Document translation process and add instructions for new languages.
- Conduct accessibility (a11y) audit and document findings.
- Add accessibility guidelines to contribution docs.
- Create/expand `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Encourage community contributions by labeling good first issues and maintaining clear documentation.

---

## **Execution Notes**
- Tackle phases sequentially or in parallel as team resources allow.
- Review and iterate after each phase, incorporating feedback from users and contributors.
- Use this plan as a living document—update as new needs and opportunities arise.

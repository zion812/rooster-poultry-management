# Rooster App UI/Navigation Enhancement â€“ Batch 2 Summary

## Overview
Batch 2 of the UI and navigation refactor focused on standardizing the structure, theming, and usability of key user, order, and support screens. The goal was to ensure all major flows use the `StandardScreenLayout` composable for consistent padding, scrolling, and Material3 theming, while improving maintainability and accessibility.

---

## Screens Refactored in Batch 2
- **CartScreen**
- **FeedbackScreen**
- **OrderHistoryScreen**
- **OrderDetailScreen**
- **PaymentScreen**
- **ProfileEditScreen**
- **HelpSupportScreen**

All of these screens now:
- Use `StandardScreenLayout` at the root for layout consistency
- Apply MaterialTheme colors and typography throughout
- Support vertical scrolling where needed
- Use string resources for all user-facing text
- Are structured for better accessibility (font scaling, touch targets)

---

## Key Changes and Rationale
- **Root Layout Unification:** Manual `Column` or `LazyColumn` replaced with `StandardScreenLayout` for predictable padding and scrolling.
- **MaterialTheme Enforcement:** All text and UI elements use Material3 theme values for color and typography.
- **Localization:** All user-facing strings use string resources to support Telugu/English.
- **Accessibility:** Layouts are more responsive to font scaling and maintain proper touch target sizes.

---

## Challenges & Notes
- Some screens required careful handling of nested layouts and scrollable content.
- Ensured that top bars, FABs, and dialogs were not affected by layout changes.
- No major regressions found during initial QA, but further device/orientation testing recommended.

---

## Recommendations for Next Steps
- **Manual QA:** Review all refactored screens on multiple devices and orientations.
- **Automated UI Tests:** Update or add Compose UI tests for these screens.
- **Documentation:** Use this summary as a template for future batches.
- **Plan Batch 3:** Next, target Marketplace, Messaging, and other high-traffic modules.

---

## Best Practices Established
- Always use `StandardScreenLayout` for new/refactored screens.
- Apply MaterialTheme and string resources everywhere.
- Consider accessibility and localization in all UI changes.

# Base requirements - will be expanded as needed
# For a web framework like Flask or Django, add them here e.g.:
# Flask==2.3.2
# For database interaction e.g.:
# SQLAlchemy==2.0.20
# psycopg2-binary==2.9.7 (if using PostgreSQL)

# For now, it's a simple structure with no external libraries beyond standard Python.
# Potential future additions:
# - GUI library (e.g., PyQt5, Tkinter, Kivy) if it's a desktop app
# - Database ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Peewee)
# - API client library (e.g., requests)
# - Data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy)
# - Graphing libraries (e.g., matplotlib, plotly)
requests==2.31.0 # For making HTTP requests to weather API

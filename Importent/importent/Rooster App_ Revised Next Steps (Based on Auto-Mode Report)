# Rooster App: Revised Next Steps (Based on Auto-Mode Report)

Based *entirely* on the claims made in the latest "auto-mode" report you provided, the project status has dramatically shifted. If this report is accurate, the previously outlined development tasks are complete, and the immediate next steps are focused on deployment and testing:

**Immediate Next Steps (According to Auto-Mode Report):**

1.  **Deploy to Beta Testing / UAT:** Since the report claims the app is production-ready and UAT-ready, the immediate action is to deploy the current build to the target group of 20-50 farmers for User Acceptance Testing.
2.  **Real-World Performance Validation:** Begin real-world testing on target devices and networks (especially 2G) to confirm the performance optimizations reported.
3.  **User Feedback Collection:** Actively gather and analyze feedback from the UAT testers using the integrated feedback mechanisms (presumably including Crashlytics and potentially other methods).

**Points for Clarification:**

*   **Confirmation:** Given the significant difference between this report and the status update received just prior, confirming this advanced state is crucial.
*   **`DataSyncWorker`:** While the report states the build is stable and the *framework* is ready, clarification on whether the specific `DataSyncWorker` functionality (if distinct from other background workers) was fully implemented and tested might be useful, although the report implies all critical issues are resolved.

If the auto-mode report accurately reflects the current state, the project is ready to move directly into the user testing and validation phase.

## **🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES ANALYSIS**

### **Priority 1: Memory Crisis** (BLOCKING)

**Evidence**:

```
🔥 Heap Dump Analysis:
├── java_pid11509.hprof: 5.4GB (MASSIVE)
├── java_pid42379.hprof: 4.4GB (MASSIVE)
└── java_pid6707.hprof: 4.2GB (MASSIVE)

💾 Total Memory Footprint: 14GB+
🎯 Target Device RAM: 2GB (rural devices)
📱 Impact: App completely unusable
```

**Root Causes Identified**:

1. **ViewModel Resource Leaks**: 15+ ViewModels without proper `onCleared()` cleanup
2. **Compose Recomposition Loops**: Unstable state causing infinite recompositions
3. **Bitmap Loading**: No optimization for large images
4. **OkHttp Connection Pools**: Improper network client management

### **Priority 2: Feature Integration Gap** (HIGH)

**Current Situation**:

```kotlin
// ❌ CURRENT: RoosterNavHost.kt uses placeholders
composable("farmer_home") {
    FarmerHomeScreen(...) // This is a placeholder function
}

// ✅ REQUIRED: Import real feature screens
import com.example.rooster.feature.farmerhome.ui.FarmerHomeScreen
composable("farmer_home") {
    FarmerHomeScreen(...) // Real screen from feature module
}
```

**Impact**: Despite having feature modules, users see placeholder screens instead of actual
functionality.

### **Priority 3: Backend Integration Missing** (HIGH)

**Paradox Discovered**:

- **Python API**: 80% complete with 15+ endpoints ready
- **Android Integration**: 0% - No connection between systems

**Available Endpoints Not Being Used**:

```python
✅ Available but unused:
├── GET  /api/farms/{id}                # Farm details
├── GET  /farm/production_summary/{id}  # Production metrics  
├── GET  /farm/health_alerts/{id}       # Health alerts
├── GET  /weather/current_by_coords     # Weather data
└── [10+ more endpoints ready]
```

|-----------|-----------|----------|------------------|------------------|
| **👨‍🌾 Farmer** | ❌ Placeholder | ⚠️ 30% | ❌ No API | ❌ Not ready |
| **🛒 Buyer** | ❌ Placeholder | ⚠️ 30% | ❌ No API | ❌ Not ready |
| **👩‍💼 Admin** | ❌ Placeholder | ⚠️ 25% | ❌ No API | ❌ Not ready |
| **👨‍⚕️ Vet** | ❌ Placeholder | ⚠️ 25% | ❌ No API | ❌ Not ready |

### **Phase 2: STAGED ROLLOUT (Recommended)**

#### **Week 1-2: Core Module Deployment**

```bash
# Deploy minimal working app with:
- Authentication (Firebase)
- Basic marketplace
- Telugu UI
- Offline functionality
```

#### **Week 3-4: Feature Integration**

```bash
# Add advanced features:
- Auction system
- Farm management

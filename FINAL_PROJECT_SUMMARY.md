## **⚠️ REMAINING WORK (2-4 hours)**

### **Build System Fix** (Primary Blocker)

```bash
# Issue: Plugin version conflicts
Error resolving plugin [id: 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt', version: '1.9.20']

# Solution: Remove unnecessary kapt from UI-only modules
- core/core-common ❌ (remove kapt)
- feature/feature-marketplace ❌ (remove kapt)  
- feature/feature-auctions ❌ (remove kapt)
- Keep kapt only in modules with @Inject/@Entity/@Dao
```

### **Integration Testing** (30 minutes)

```bash
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
./gradlew :app:installDebug
# Test navigation flows
```

### **Python Backend Connection** (15 minutes)

```bash
cd farm_management
python start_api_server.py
# Available at http://10.0.2.2:5000 for Android emulator
```
